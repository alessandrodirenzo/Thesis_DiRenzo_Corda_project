This file allows to run the scripts in order to generate the files for each step of the method proposed.
It is possible to generate the file for the running example (AffiliatedVisit) and for the three cases analyzed in the validation test (BirthCertificateIssue, HospitalTeleconsultation, HospitalTelevisitExternal). 

# Steps to execute in order to reproduce the generation of files through Python scripts

Step 1:
**From collaboration to choreography tasks**

Affiliated visit:
Birth certificate issue:
HospitalTeleconsultation:
HospitalTelevisitExternal:

Step 2:
**Generation of additional tasks from choreography diagram enriched with security notations**

Step 3:
**From choreography diagram to Corda Java classes**

Additional step:
**Generation of textual Corda template**
